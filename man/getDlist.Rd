\title{Distance computation with lots of disatnce measures.}
\usage{
getDlist(x, mtd = "euclidean", p = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class \code{matrix}. Each column corresponds to a sample and each row to a variable.}

\item{mtd}{a character string that represents the distance measure to be used. It could be one or some of the 47 measures(\code{showDistMethods()}). If users want to use all the measures, \code{all} could be selected in this function. For more information, please see Details.}

\item{p}{The power of Minkowski distance. Note that setting p = 1 is equivalent to calculating the Manhattan distance and setting p = 2 is equivalent to calculating the Euclidean distance. Default: \code{p = 2}.}
}
\value{
an object of class \code{"dist"} or an object if class \code{"list"}.
}
\description{
This is a distance matrix computation function which containins 47 measures. It computes between the rows of a matrix and return the distance matrix computed by choosing the specific measure.
